# SNeRateCalcs
This repository contains the code for undertaking rate density estimations of supernovae out to low redshifts as well as a bootstrapping technique that applies 95% confidence intervals to said rate estimations.

**Supernovae Rate Density Calculations and Bootstrapping for Confidence Intervals**
This document contains a description of routines used to estimate supernovae rate densities at low redshifts and apply a bootstrapping technique to apply 95% confidence intervals to said rate estimation as well as requirements to run said routines. These routines work in conjunction with supernovae datasets grabbed from the BTS (Bright Transient Survey) website (see link in appendix).
